**Calculator Application with JDBC**
 
This repository contains a Java calculator application with a simple command-line interface. The calculator allows users to perform various mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. The application also uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to record the history of calculations in a MySQL database.

**Features**
Interactive command-line interface for performing calculations.
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, modulo, and area calculations.
Utilizes JDBC to connect to a MySQL database.
Records calculation history in a database table.
Provides an option to display the history of calculations.

**Getting Started**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up a MySQL database and adjust the database connection details in the code.
Compile and run the Java program using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.

**Usage**
Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
Choose an operation and input the required values.
Optionally, view the calculation history.

**Requirements**
Java Development Kit (JDK)
MySQL database

**Acknowledgements**
This project is a simple example to demonstrate the usage of Java, JDBC, and MySQL. Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code to suit your needs.
